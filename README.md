DESCRIPTION :This project has been built to extract customer reviews through an  automated script from all the existing car selling websites based on the trending campaigns in the market with respect to each car model. These reviews further undergo a few pre-processing NLP techniques and are mapped to a pre-built Online Brand Scoring Framework (comprising of Dimesnion, Theme & Topic and a bunch of expected keywords against them). 
Once I have the cleansed keywords from the reviews mapped to each Dimension, Theme & Topic to which some pre-defined weightage has been assigned based on my client's requests, the next step was Model Sentiment Tagging where I have assigned a polarity (positve, negative or neutral) to each keyword (from customer reviews) & also analyzed these results using a Classification Algorithm.
Further, after using the results of the above, I rolled up the keyword scores to its respective Topic, Theme & Dimension score and then, achieved at a Unified Car Model Score.

PURPOSE OF THIS PROJECT : This Online Brand Scoring Model can now be used by the marketing team of any car brand to compare not its models but also compare them with their competitors in the market. Also, this model can be tweaked for any comoodity brand.
